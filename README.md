## Repository Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `code/`: Contains the code related to extracting data.
- `practice/`: Contains sample code used in familiarization with the basic extraction process.
- `tasteofhome/`: Contains the code to extract recipe details from the Taste of Home website.
- `README.md`: The document you are currently reading, providing an overview of the repository.

Feel free to explore the different directories to access the code samples and data files.

## Features
